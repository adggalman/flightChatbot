# Flight Booking Automation Showcase

This project is a full-stack application designed to showcase skills in modern web development, mobile app development, and test automation. It simulates a real-world flight booking system, from searching for flights to managing bookings.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a portfolio piece that demonstrates proficiency across the entire development lifecycle, including:

-   **Backend Development:** Building a robust REST API with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
-   **Frontend Development:** Creating a cross-platform mobile application with React Native and Expo.
-   **Third-Party API Integration:** Interfacing with the Amadeus Travel API for real-time flight data.
-   **Mock Service Creation:** Simulating airline-specific operations with a custom mock API.
-   **Authentication:** Implementing secure user authentication with Passport.js and JWT.
-   **Test Automation:** Writing BDD-style end-to-end tests with Cucumber.js and Appium.
-   **CI/CD:** Automating the build, test, and deployment process with GitHub Actions.
