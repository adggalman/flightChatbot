# Flight Booking Automation Showcase

> ⚠️ **You are on the `boilerplate` branch.**
> This branch has the folder structure scaffolded but all implementation files empty — it's your starting point for building this project step by step as a learning exercise.
>
> For the fully built project, live links, step-by-step build guide, and local setup instructions, see the **[main branch README](https://github.com/adggalman/flightChatbot/blob/main/README.md)**.

## Where to Start

1. Read the [main branch README](https://github.com/adggalman/flightChatbot/blob/main/README.md) — understand the architecture, tech stack, and what you're building
2. Come back to this branch and start implementing layer by layer, following the How We Built This steps in that README
3. Use `main` as your reference implementation when you get stuck
